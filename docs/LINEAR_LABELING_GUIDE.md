## 📏 Label Application Rules

### Required Labels *(Always Apply)*

**Every issue MUST have these four labels:**

1. **Development Phase**: Which sprint does this belong to?
2. **Technical Domain**: What primary expertise is needed?
3. **Work Classification**: What type of work is this?
4. **Effort Estimation**: How big is this task?

### Optional Labels *(Apply When Relevant)*

5. **Component Area**: Does this affect a specific UI section?

### ❌ Label Conflicts to Avoid

**Never apply multiple labels from the same group:**
- ❌ `Sprint-1` + `Sprint-2` (choose one sprint)
- ❌ `Frontend` + `DevOps` (choose primary domain)
- ❌ `Small` + `Medium` (choose one size)

## 🎯 Application Examples

### Example 1: "Create Navigation Component"
```yaml
Required Labels:
  Sprint: Sprint-3          # Navigation work planned for Sprint 3
  Domain: Frontend          # React/UI component work
  Type: Feature            # New functionality
  Size: Medium             # Complex component with mobile menu

Optional Label:
  Component: Navigation    # Specifically navigation area
```

### Example 2: "Fix ESLint Configuration"
```yaml
Required Labels:
  Sprint: Sprint-1         # Code quality is Sprint 1 work
  Domain: Quality Assurance # Linting and code standards
  Type: Bug               # Fixing existing configuration
  Size: Small             # Quick configuration fix

Optional Label:
  Component: [none]       # No specific UI component
```

### Example 3: "Implement 3D Hero Graphics"
```yaml
Required Labels:
  Sprint: Sprint-4         # Hero section planned for Sprint 4
  Domain: Animation        # 3D graphics and animations
  Type: Feature           # New 3D implementation
  Size: Large             # Complex 3D development

Optional Label:
  Component: Graphics 3D   # Specifically 3D graphics work
```

## 🔍 Filtering Strategies

### Common Filter Combinations

**Sprint Planning:**
```bash
Sprint-2 + Feature → All new features for current sprint
Sprint-2 + Small → Quick wins for current sprint
Sprint-2 + Frontend → All UI work for current sprint
```

**Domain Focus:**
```bash
Frontend + Medium → Multi-day UI development tasks
DevOps + Small → Quick infrastructure improvements
Quality Assurance + Feature → New testing implementations
```

**Effort Planning:**
```bash
Small + Feature → Quick feature implementations
Large + Backend → Major server-side development
XS + Bug → Quick bug fixes for immediate completion
```

**Component Development:**
```bash
Navigation + Frontend → All navigation-related UI work
Hero Section + Animation → Hero area motion work
Layout System + Frontend → Design system development
```

---

## 📊 Project Analytics

### Sprint Velocity Tracking
Monitor completion rates by effort size:
```bash
Sprint-1: 2 Medium + 3 Small = 5 tasks (baseline velocity)
Sprint-2: Compare completion rate against Sprint-1 baseline
```

### Domain Workload Balance
Track resource allocation:
```bash
Frontend: 60% of issues → UI-heavy development
DevOps: 30% of issues → Infrastructure focus
Quality Assurance: 10% of issues → Quality maintenance
```

### Effort Calibration
Validate size estimates:
```bash
Small tasks: Actually completed in < 1 day?
Medium tasks: Actually took 1-3 days?
Large tasks: Required 3-5 days as estimated?
```

## 🛠️ Best Practices

### For Issue Creation
1. **Always start with required labels** (Sprint, Domain, Type, Size)
2. **Choose the PRIMARY domain** if work spans multiple areas
3. **Estimate conservatively** - better to overestimate than underestimate
4. **Add component labels** only when work is component-specific

### For Sprint Planning
1. **Filter by current sprint** to see active work
2. **Balance effort sizes** - mix Small, Medium, Large tasks
3. **Group by domain** to assign to specialists
4. **Track velocity** using effort completion rates

### For Progress Tracking
1. **Use sprint labels** to measure completion
2. **Monitor domain distribution** for resource planning
3. **Calibrate effort estimates** based on actual completion times
4. **Update labels** if scope or domain changes

## 🔗 Integration with Linear Features

### Native Linear Features *(Use Instead of Labels)*
- **Status**: Use Linear's built-in status (Backlog, In Progress, Done, etc.)
- **Priority**: Use Linear's priority system (Urgent, High, Normal, Low)
- **Assignee**: Use Linear's assignment feature
- **Due Date**: Use Linear's date tracking

### Label System Complements
- **Labels**: Focus on categorization and filtering
- **Status**: Track workflow progression
- **Priority**: Indicate urgency and importance
- **Assignee**: Show responsibility and ownership
