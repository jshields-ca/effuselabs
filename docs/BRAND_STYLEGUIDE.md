### 2. The Logos

Our logo system is built on the concept of **"Source & Expression."** Effuse Labs is the foundational source of innovation, while Lumina is the radiant expression of that innovation.

#### 2.1 Primary Logos

- **Effuse Labs Logo:** The "Hatching Core." An abstract, fluid drop shape. An outer shell with a slate-to-teal gradient peels back to reveal a radiant golden orb at its center. It represents the process of revealing valuable insight from complex data.
- **Lumina Logo:** The "Radiant Spark." A dynamic sunrise or spark shape with a vibrant gold-to-coral gradient. This mark is energetic and represents light, clarity, and growth.

#### 2.2 Secondary Mark / Favicon

- **Name:** The "Spark" Icon.
- **Description:** This is the official secondary brand mark for Effuse Labs. It is a simplified, minimalist icon derived from the "Hatching Core" logo, representing the core 'spark' of insight and innovation.
- **Primary Usage:** This icon is to be used in applications where the full primary logo is too detailed or small to be legible. Specific use cases include:
  - **Favicons:** For web browser tabs.
  - **Social Media Profiles:** As the primary profile picture on all social channels.
  - **App Icons:** As the basis for mobile or desktop application icons.
  - **UI Elements:** Within the Lumina software for loading indicators or compact menu buttons where space is limited.

#### 2.3 Logo Usage Rules

- **Clear Space:** Maintain a minimum clear space around the logos equal to 1/4 of the height of the abstract mark itself. No other elements should enter this zone.
- **Minimum Size:** Digital: 48px height. Print: 20mm height.

#### 2.4 Logo Misuse

- **DO NOT** stretch, condense, rotate, or change proportions.
- **DO NOT** change the approved brand colours or gradients.
- **DO NOT** add outlines, drop shadows, or other visual effects.
- **DO NOT** place on a visually cluttered background.
