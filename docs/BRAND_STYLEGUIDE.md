This document is the official brand style guide for Effuse Labs and its flagship product, Lumina. Our brand is more than just a logo; it's a promise to our users. This guide ensures that we communicate our story with clarity, consistency, and confidence across all platforms. Our mission is to pour out a continuous stream of innovative ideas and elegant code to empower small businesses. This guide shows how we present that mission to the world.

### 2. The Logos

Our logo system is built on the concept of **"Source & Expression."** Effuse Labs is the foundational source of innovation, while Lumina is the radiant expression of that innovation.

#### 2.1 Primary Logos

* **Effuse Labs Logo:** The "Signature Flow." A stylized lowercase 'e' where the tail extends into a gentle wave. It is rendered with a dimensional teal gradient. This mark is personal, foundational, and represents the flow of ideas.
* **Lumina Logo:** The "Radiant Spark." A dynamic sunrise or spark shape made of flowing arcs. It is rendered in a vibrant gold-to-coral gradient. This mark is energetic and represents light, clarity, and growth.

#### 2.2 Logo Usage Rules

* **Clear Space:** To ensure legibility and impact, always maintain a minimum clear space around the logos. This exclusion zone should be equal to the height of the 'e' in the Effuse Labs logo or the height of the 'L' in the Lumina wordmark. No other elements should enter this zone.
* **Minimum Size:**
    * **Digital:** The logos should never be displayed smaller than 40 pixels in height.
    * **Print:** The logos should never be printed smaller than 15mm in height.

#### 2.3 Logo Misuse

To maintain brand integrity, never alter the logos.
* **DO NOT** stretch, condense, or change the proportions.
* **DO NOT** change the approved brand colours or gradients.
* **DO NOT** add outlines, drop shadows, or other visual effects.
* **DO NOT** place the logo on a visually cluttered background. Use a solid colour background whenever possible.
* **DO NOT** rotate the logo.

    * Start: `#0B2B33` (Deep Teal)

### 4. Typography

Our typography system is built on a primary brand typeface for broad communication and specific, stylized logotypes that act as graphical assets.

#### 4.1 Logotypes

The logotypes for Effuse Labs and Lumina are custom-kerned assets and should be treated as immutable graphics. They should not be recreated by manually typing them out.

* **Effuse Labs Logotype:**
    * **Font Basis:** Inter SemiBold
    * **Style:** Title Case with custom letter-spacing. It uses our primary brand typeface to create a seamless and harmonious brand presence.
* **Lumina Logotype:**
    * **Font Basis:** Montserrat Bold
    * **Style:** All Caps with increased letter-spacing. The 'A' has been **customized with a flat top**, creating a unique, architectural look that reinforces precision and growth. This makes the logotype a distinct and ownable brand asset.

#### 4.2 Primary Typeface

* **Font:** **Inter**
    * **Usage:** For all headlines, sub-headlines, body copy, and UI text across both the Effuse Labs website and the Lumina application. Its versatility allows it to be both commanding and highly legible.
    * **H1 Headlines:** Inter Bold (700)
    * **H2 Headlines:** Inter SemiBold (600)
    * **Body & UI Text:** Inter Regular (400)

#### 4.3 Accent Typeface

* **Font:** **IBM Plex Mono**
    * **Usage:** To be used sparingly for displaying data, code snippets, or to add a subtle technical flavour in specific contexts like financial reports.
    * **Style:** IBM Plex Mono Regular (400)

### 5. Brand Voice & Tone

Our voice is how we sound. Our tone is how we adapt that voice to different situations.

* **Our Voice is:**
    * **Empowering, not prescriptive.** (We suggest and guide, we don't command.)
    * **Clear, not jargon-filled.** (We make complex ideas simple.)
    * **Warm, not clinical.** (We are a partner in their business.)
    * **Inspiring, not over-hyped.** (We are confident but grounded.)

### 6. Imagery Style

Our visual style for photography and illustration should align with our core values.

* **Photography:** Warm, authentic, and soft-focus. Feature creative professionals in their natural environment, feeling empowered and focused. Avoid corporate stock photos.
* **Illustration:** Clean, minimalist, and abstract. Use subtle light refractions, fluid shapes, and textures that evoke our "Water and Light" theme.
