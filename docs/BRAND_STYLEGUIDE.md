### 8. Social Media Guidelines

This section outlines the strategy for building a consistent and engaging presence on social media.

#### 8.1 Platform-Specific Tone
Our core voice remains the same, but the tone adapts to the platform's context:

* **LinkedIn:** More professional and industry-focused. Share insights on small business tech, company milestones, and the Effuse Labs mission. The tone is authoritative yet approachable.

* **Instagram/Facebook:** More visual, personal, and community-focused. Use authentic imagery, share user success stories, and post quick tips from Lumina. The tone is warm, encouraging, and celebratory.

* **Twitter (X) & BlueSky:** More conversational, concise, and immediate. Ideal for sharing quick insights, company news, blog post links, and engaging in real-time industry conversations. The tone is direct and helpful. The use of emojis can be appropriate to add personality and warmth.

#### 8.2 Visual Strategy
* **Profile Pictures:** Use the mark-only versions of the logos (the abstract "e" and "spark") for clear recognition.
* **Templates:** Create a set of branded templates using our approved fonts and color palettes for different post types (e.g., quote graphics, feature announcements, tips). This ensures visual consistency.
* **Imagery:** All imagery must align with the primary Imagery Style (Section 6). Focus on authentic people and beautiful, abstract brand textures.

#### 8.3 Content Pillars
Our social media content should revolve around these four themes:
1.  **Education & Empowerment:** Sharing valuable business tips for our target audience.
2.  **Product Showcase:** Highlighting Lumina's features and the problems they solve.
3.  **Community Spotlight:** Celebrating the successes of our clients.
4.  **Company Vision:** Communicating the "why" behind Effuse Labs and our commitment to accessibility.
